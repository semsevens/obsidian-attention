/**
 * Wrap occurrences of a quote inside an already-rendered element.
 *
 * Shared by the hosts that paint over DOM someone else produced — reading mode
 * and the transcript panel. Both work on rendered text rather than offsets,
 * because in neither case does the DOM correspond character-for-character to
 * what the anchor was measured against.
 *
 * A quote is matched across the container's text as one string and then wrapped
 * piece by piece, so a mark running from plain text through a **bold** run and
 * out the other side is painted in full. Matching within single text nodes —
 * the obvious approach — silently skipped exactly those marks, which in a real
 * note is a great many of them.
 *
 * Idempotent: text already inside a highlight is skipped, so re-running after
 * the host rebuilds costs nothing and never nests.
